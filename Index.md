## First thing will we Explin the Version Control 

* #### what the Version Control?

##### Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. you can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals

## Type of Version Control
1. ### Local Version Control
##### Created Local Version Control systems. A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
2. ### Centralized Version Control
##### The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS). This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. this is allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team membersâ€™ activities with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.
3. ### Distributed Version Control  
##### It's called also **(DVCS)** addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions. 

##### To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
