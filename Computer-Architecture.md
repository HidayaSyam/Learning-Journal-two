# Computer Architecture and Logic

## Computer :
### A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.
## How Computer Work ?

### A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an **information processor**: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it's ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.

+ Input: Your keyboard and mouse, for example, are just input units—ways of getting information into your computer that it can process.If you use a microphone and voice recognition software, that's another form of input.

+ Memory/storage: Your computer probably stores all your documents and files on a hard drive: a huge magnetic memory. But smaller, computer-based devices like digital cameras and cellphones use other kinds of storage such as flash memory cards.

+ Processing: Your computer's processor (sometimes known as the central processing unit) is a microchip buried deep inside. It works amazingly hard and gets incredibly hot in the process. That's why your computer has a little fan blowing away—to stop its brain from overheating!

+ Output: Your computer probably has an LCD screen capable of displaying high-resolution (very detailed) graphics, and probably also stereo loudspeakers. You may have an inkjet printer on your desk too to make a more permanent form of output.

## Binary Number System

### A computing device can be created out of anything that has a series of switches, each of which can alternate between an "on" position and an "off" position. These switches can be electronic, biological, or mechanical, as long as they can be moved on command from one position to the other. Most computers have electronic switches.
