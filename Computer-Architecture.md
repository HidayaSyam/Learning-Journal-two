#Computer Architecture and Logic

## Computer :
### A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

### The input devices of a computer can depend on the type of computer we are dealing with but most typically we will find a mouse, keyboard, scanner or even applications (software) installed on the computer. Once the data has been received, the central processing unit (CPU) along with the help of other components, takes over and processes the information it was given.
