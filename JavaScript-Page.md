## what is the Script?
### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal

## To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

### Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
* DEFINE THE GOAL
* DESIGN THE SCRIPT
* CODE EACH STEP

## expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

## Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
**Assign a value to a variable example color = 'beige';**
2. COMPARISON OPERATORS
**Compare two values and return true or fa1se example buy = 3 > 5;**
3. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
**Perform basic math example area = 3 * 2;**
4. LOGICAL OPERATORS
**Combine expressions and return true or fa1se buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);**
5. STRING OPERATORS
**Combine two strings example greeting= 'Hi' + 'Molly';**

# What is the Funcations ??
## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.
